Hi, I'm a friendly geek who doesn't talk too much. I dislike putting my face
on things and the Internet is no exception, but if you really need a photo you
can send me an [email][email-me].

### Short Bio
I did my undergraduate studies at the School of ECE of the [National Technical
University of Athens][ece-ntua] on April 2017; my thesis focused on the
relation between [mathematical morphology][mathematical-morphology] and [tropical
geometry][tropical-geometry], as well as a few bits and pieces of optimization.
My thesis supervisor was Professor [Petros Maragos][maragos-page].
You can grab a copy of it in Greek [here][thesis-link].

From May to August 2017, I worked as a Researcher at INRIA Paris-Saclay, as
part of the [TROPICAL][tropical-inria] team. I was lucky enough to be supervised
by and collaborated with [Xavier Allamigeon][allamigeon-page]. Our work
focused on the formalization of convex polyhedra using the
[Coq proof assistant][coq], as well as the [Mathematical Components][mathcomp]
library.

Since August 2017, I'm a PhD student at the dept. of [Operations
Research][orie] at Cornell University, where I intend to focus on mathematical
optimization, nonconvex problems, and (maybe?) some probability. My advisor is
[Damek Davis][davis-page].

Some of my research interests are:
* **Continuous Optimization** - but honestly, who is *not* interested in this?
* **Nonconvex problems** - I like the idea of being able to exploit structure in
  difficult problems. "Nonconvex" is also a cool word to say at parties.
* **Tropical Geometry** - I don't yet have such a rigorous background to appreciate
  it in all its beauty, but a lot of elegant results about dimension /
  complexity can be stated using methods from tropical geometry.
* **Machine Learning** - I love everything abo...just kidding, I don't. But I
  find attempts to explain its limitations using mathematical insight
  interesting.
* **Formalization of Mathematics** - this is a fairly recent interest of mine,
  but it turns out there is a growing demand for formalized proofs among the
  mathematical community. Read [this article][kepler-conjecture] if you, like
  me a few months before, don't have the slightest idea why.
